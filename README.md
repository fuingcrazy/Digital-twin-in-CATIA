Control a virtual hand in CATIA(A modeling software) with your hands !
CATIA(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CATIA) is a usful modeling tool for mechanical engineering. 
In a project we designed a virtual hand in CATIA, and made it move by detecting the movements of our own hands. Here is an example image:

It's a dynamic control process, watch the whole video in 'Show.mp4'.
Remember that you should install CATIA and open the hand projcet FIRST !, or the python program will not capture the model successfully.
